## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There are no special requirements to run this project. The Anaconda distribution of Python should be more than enough, running with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this exercise I was interested in using the AirBnB information provided [here](https://www.kaggle.com/airbnb/boston?select=reviews.csv) for the city of Boston.

The AirBnB team suggests the following questions of interest for analysis:

1. Can you describe the vibe of each Boston neighborhood using listing descriptions?
2. What are the busiest times of the year to visit Boston? 
3. By how much do prices spike?
4. Is there a general upward trend of both new Airbnb listings and total Airbnb visitors to Boston?

But what I realy would like to find out is if...

1. There is a strong correlation between the size of the listing and its price.
2. Location is the most important variable for demand and pricing.
3. Past reviews impact future listings of the place.


Content
The following Airbnb activity is included in this Boston dataset:

Listings, including full descriptions and average review score
Reviews, including unique id for each reviewer and detailed comments
Calendar, including listing id and the price and availability for that day

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There are 3 notebooks available here to showcase work related to the above questions.  Each of the notebooks is exploratory in searching through the data pertaining to the questions showcased by the notebook title.  Markdown cells were used to assist in walking through the thought process for individual steps.  

There is an additional `.py` file that runs the necessary code to obtain the final model used to predict salary.

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://mpradam.medium.com/boston-airbnb-to-comment-or-not-to-comment-435e2beb911).
